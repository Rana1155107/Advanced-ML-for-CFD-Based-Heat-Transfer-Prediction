# Advanced-ML-for-CFD-Based-Heat-Transfer-Prediction
This project applies machine learning to predict the average Nusselt number using a multi-parameter CFD-inspired dataset. Multiple regression models are trained and compared to capture nonlinear heat transfer behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-driven surrogate modeling for complex thermo-fluid systems.
